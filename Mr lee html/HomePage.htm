           <h1>My Favourite Teacher</h1>
        <p>
            In 2016 I had a teacher who always made me do my best.
             Her name was Mrs Lawson. She could sense when I was lazy and made me do the work despite my lazyness. 
            She was my favourite teacher at Gordon West

            <h1>Clubs I Participated In</h1>
            <p>
                I was in the choir but didn't participate in much else as I am lazy.

            <h1>My Favourite Food In The Canteen</h1>
            <p>
                My favourite food from the canteen was Pizza Singlez. They sadly got rid of it as it was too unhealthy.
